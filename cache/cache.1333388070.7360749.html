          Why should I learn about computing?
         </b>
         <br />
         There are three big reasons, the first two of which apply to everyone:
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          To understand the world, you need to understand computing and programming.
          <br />
          So much of our world today depends on computation whether you're talking about cars (a few wheels and an engine attached to many computers running huge programs), communications, or cooking.  Without understanding computers and how they are programmed, much of the world will increasingly seem like magic, and you will be at its mercy.
         </li>
         <li>
          Being able to program provides personal empowerment.
          <br />
          Twenty years ago, Steve Jobs famously talking about computers as bicycles for the mind.  Today, computers are far more powerful and connected worldwide --- super-tanker-sized hypersonic spaceships of the mind.  Without learning to program, you can still ride them if you are willing to remove your shoes at the security checkpoint and go where the pilot wants to go, but if you want to be the one flying you need to learn about programming.
         </li>
         <li>
          Computing opens the door to some of the best jobs in the world, and enables almost everyone to do their job better.
          <br />
          Last year,
          <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/best-jobs/2011/fast-growing-jobs/1.html">
           Money Magazine
          </a>
          reported that Software Developer as the #1 job for fast growth (#7 is IT Consultant). The
          <a href="http://www.sdtimes.com/link/35710">
           SD Times
          </a>
          reported that computer science majors received more job offers than any other major.
          <a href="http://www.careercast.com/jobs-rated/10-best-jobs-2011">
           CareerCast
          </a>
          reports "Software Engineer, a job that involves the design and creation of software for everything from operating systems to cell phone "apps" to interactive games, ranks as the best job of 2011."

          What programming language does the course use?
         </b>
         <br />
         We will be using Python (Version 2.6). Python is a great language for learning to program since it simple and easy to get started in, but it is also powerful enough to be widely used for building web sites (including Google), performing scientific computation, and creating games. The concepts we cover in the class are not specific to Python, but apply to computer science in general no matter what programming language you are using.

         <br />
         There is no required textbook for the course, and the course content does not follow any textbook. There are many books available on Python programming that may be helpful to students. For a comprehensive list of resources targeting new programmers, check out

          Can you really build a search engine in seven weeks?
         </b>
         <br />
         You can, and we'll show you how! The core components of a search engine are surprisingly simple, and with a language as concise as Python, the entire program is only about one page of code. You will write key parts of this code yourself, and should completely understand the full search engine code by the end of the course.
        </p>
        <p>
         Over the first three weeks, we will build a web crawler, which is a program that collects content from web pages to use in the search engine. In week 4, we'll build an index to be able to respond to queries.  In week 5, we'll make the index fast enough that it could scale to a large collection of pages. In week 6, we'll implement a method for finding the best page for a search query, similar to the way Google ranks pages.

          Are there homework assignments?
         </b>
         <br />
         Yes. To learn computer science, it is important to solve progressively more challenging problems on your own, so there will be six graded homework assignments, one at the end of each unit. The homework assignments are due Tuesday night at
         <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=23%3A59+UTC">
          23:59 UTC
         </a>
         and a new one will be posted immediately after.  The homework assignments will be similar to the in-class quizzes and mostly cover material from that week's unit, except the homework assignments will include larger problems for you to solve on your own and you will be graded on the answers you submit.

          Can I get an extension on a homework assignment?
         </b>
         <br />
         No.  We understand that sometimes things come up that make it impossible to meet deadlines, but in a class this size it is impossible to fairly grant extensions.  Note, though, that your lowest homework score is dropped in computing the final grade, so it will not count against you if you miss one homework assignment.

         </b>
         <br />
         Your final grade will be the maximum of two different calculations. The first is determined 50% based on the homework assignments and 50% based on the final exam. For the homework assignments, your lowest homework score will be dropped. The remaining five homework assignments will count equally, as 10% of your total grade each. The alternative weighting is based 100% on the final exam. This allows students starting late to still earn a perfect score in the class.

          What are the rules on collaboration?
         </b>
         <br />
         Working with other students is often the best way to learn new things, and we hope students in the class will form vibrant communities, both on-line and in-person, to help each other learn.  The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them.
        </p>
        <p>
         You are welcome (and encouraged) to view the lectures with others, and discuss and work together on answering the in-lecture quizzes.  For the homeworks, you may discuss the questions with other students in the on-line forums and in-person study groups, but everything you submit should be your own work.  For the final exam, you are not permitted to work with anyone else, and should only ask clarification questions on the on-line forums which will be answered by the course staff.
